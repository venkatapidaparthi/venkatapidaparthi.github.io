        <h1>Basic and Preliminary Vega-Lite Visualizations</h1>

        <h2>Visualization - 1</h2>
        <p>This visualizationis a representation of traffic crash 
            data on an hourly and weekly basis. It's created from a dataset where the crash dates are converted to datetime format,
             allowing for the extraction of specific hours and days of the week.

            The core of the visualization is a heatmap, where the x-axis represents the hours of the day (0 to 23) and the y-axis 
            indicates the days of the week. Each cell in the heatmap corresponds to the combination of a specific hour and day, 
            with the color intensity indicating the number of crashes that occurred during that time. The color scheme used is 
            shades of orange, with darker shades representing higher numbers of crashes. This is accompanied by tooltips that 
            provide exact numbers of crashes for each hour and day combination.
            
            This heatmap offers a clear visual representation of crash patterns, allowing for easy identification of peak times 
            for accidents throughout the week. For instance, users can quickly discern if more crashes occur during specific 
            hours or on certain days.</p>

        <h2>Visualization - 2</h2>
        <p>
            This bar chart, presents a clear visualization of traffic crash 
            frequencies in the top 10 ZIP codes with the most incidents. The ZIP codes are displayed along the x-axis,
             and the corresponding number of crashes is represented by the height of each bar, colored with the 'viridis' 
             palette for easy differentiation. This chart effectively highlights areas with higher crash counts, 
             useful for urban planning and safety analysis. </p>
        <div id="vis2"></div>

        <h2>Visualization - 3</h2>
        <p>This visualization, titled "Bubble Chart of Traffic Crashes by Day of Week correlating The month of crash and 
            the Hour of crash occurrence," is a bubble chart that offers a multi-dimensional view of traffic crash data. 
            The chart plots crash hours (x-axis) against crash months (y-axis), with each bubble's size representing 
            the total number of injuries associated with each incident. Additionally, the bubbles are color-coded by
             the day of the week, utilizing a 20b-category color scheme for distinct visualization.

            The tooltip feature provides detailed information for each bubble, including the crash hour, month, total injuries, 
            and the day of the week. This enables us to discern patterns and correlations between the time of crash 
            (both hourly and monthly) and the resultant injuries, as well as how these factors vary across different days of the week.
            
            This bubble chart effectively combines several variables to give a comprehensive overview of crash data, 
            revealing potential temporal trends and injury severity patterns. </p>

        <h2>Visualization - 4</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <div id="vis4"></div>

        <h2>Visualization - 5</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <div id="vis5"></div>

        <h2>Visualization - 6</h2>
        <p>The visualization combines a bar chart and a line chart to analyze 
            traffic crashes, using a dataset with dates converted to year-month format. The bar chart shows crash counts by person 
            type (e.g., driver, pedestrian), using opacity and color differentiation, while the line chart tracks the trend of 
            crashes over time for each person type, complete with tooltips for detailed month, person type, and crash count 
            information. To use this chart, we should observe the overall trends in the line chart for temporal patterns, 
            compare crash counts across person types in the bar chart, interactively hover for specifics, and analyze for any 
             patterns or anomalies. This layered approach provides a rich, multi-dimensional view of crash data, 
             though it doesn't imply causation. A zoom in interaction has also been provided to view the minor attributes properly.</p>

        <h1>Vega-Lite Visualizations (PIE REPRESENTATIONS)</h1>

        <h2>PIE REPRESENTATION - 1</h2>
        <p>This visualization features two pie charts analyzing traffic crashes based on "Weather Conditions" and "Lighting Conditions,
            " each using a vibrant 20-category color scheme. The charts, show the 
            distribution of crashes under various conditions, with each slice representing a different condition and its count.
             The interactive tooltips provide specific counts for each condition, offering a clear, color-coded breakdown of how
              weather and lighting impact crash occurrences. </p>
        <div id="vis6"></div>

        <h2>PIE REPRESENTATION - 2 </h2>
        <p>This pie chart, titled "Roadway Surface Condition Distribution," visualizes the distribution of traffic crashes based 
            on different roadway surface conditions. The chart, offers a segmented view with each slice indicating a specific condition, along with interactive tooltips 
             providing the count for each surface type. </p>
        <div id="vis7"></div>

        <h2>PIE REPRESENTATION - 3</h2>
        <p>The pie chart "Primary Contributory Cause Distribution" illustrates the varied causes of traffic crashes.
             it features interactive tooltips that provide the count for each contributory cause,
             offering a visually engaging and informative breakdown of crash factors. </p>
        <div id="vis8"></div>

        <h2>PIE REPRESENTATIONS - 4</h2>
        <p>The "First Crash Type Distribution" pie chart provides an insightful visualization of different initial crash 
            types in a traffic dataset. It presents a clear breakdown of each 
            crash type's frequency, 
            enhanced with interactive tooltips for specific count details. </p>
        <div id="vis9"></div>

        
        
        <h1>BOX & VIOLIN PLOTS</h1>

        <h2>BOX PLOT</h2>
        <p>This Vega visualization illustrates the distribution of ages across different
             months in a given dataset. Each boxplot corresponds to a month, showcasing the age spread through medians, quartiles, and extremes,
              allowing for a comparative view of age distributions over time. The horizontal orientation of the months with the vertical
               distribution of ages, 
            coupled with a clear title and axis labels, provides a straightforward and informative analysis of age variations by month. </p>
        <div id="vis12"></div>

        <h2>VIOLIN PLOTS</h2>
        <p>This visualization features a series of violin plots, each representing the density distribution of traffic 
            crashes by hour under different weather conditions. The plots are horizontally oriented, with crash hours on the y-axis
             and density values on the x-axis. Each violin plot corresponds to a specific weather condition, color-coded for distinction,
              and the collection of plots is arranged in a grid layout with three columns. Tooltips provide detailed information for each 
              crash hour. The use of density plots allows for a nuanced understanding of how crash frequencies vary throughout the day under 
              different weather scenarios, based on a sampled dataset. This format offers a visual comparison across various weather conditions, 
            highlighting potential patterns or anomalies in crash occurrences related to weather. </p>
